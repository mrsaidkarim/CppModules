## Copy Assignment Operator vs Default Assignment Operator

### Introduction
In C++, the assignment operator (`=`) is used to copy the values from one object to another of the same type. By default, the compiler provides a default assignment operator, but there are situations where defining a custom copy assignment operator is necessary to ensure proper resource management and to handle deep copies.

### Default Assignment Operator
The default assignment operator provided by the compiler performs a shallow copy of the object's data members. This means it copies the values of the data members directly from the source object to the destination object.

### Custom Copy Assignment Operator
A custom copy assignment operator is necessary when the class manages dynamic resources, such as pointers to heap-allocated memory. The custom operator ensures proper resource management, such as deep copying and preventing memory leaks.


Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Buffer {
private:
    int* data;
    size_t size;

public:
    // Constructor
    Buffer(size_t size) : size(size) {
        data = new int[size];
        for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            data[i] = i;
        }
        std::cout << "Buffer of size " << size << " created." << std::endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Buffer() {
        delete[] data;
        std::cout << "Buffer destroyed." << std::endl;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    Buffer(const Buffer &other) : size(other.size) {
        data = new int[size];
        for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            data[i] = other.data[i];
        }
        std::cout << "Buffer copied." << std::endl;
    }

    // Custom Copy Assignment Operator
    Buffer& operator=(const Buffer &other) {
        // Self-assignment check
        if (this != &other) {
            // Free existing resource
            delete[] data;

            // Allocate new resource and copy values
            size = other.size;
            data = new int[size];
            for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                data[i] = other.data[i];
            }
            std::cout << "Buffer assigned." << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Self-assignment detected." << std::endl;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    void print() const {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            std::cout << data[i] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Buffer buf1(5);
    Buffer buf2(10);

    buf2 = buf1; // Uses the custom assignment operator in this case is necessary.

    buf1.print();
    buf2.print();

    return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion
Using a custom copy assignment operator is essential in classes that manage dynamic resources or require deep copying. It ensures proper resource management, avoids potential issues like memory leaks or double deletion, and handles self-assignment efficiently. The default assignment operator is sufficient for classes with simple, non-dynamic data members, but custom operators provide the necessary control for more complex scenarios.

## Floating and fixed point representation in C++
Fixed-point representation is a real data type for integers in computers. Data can be converted into binary form using fixed point representation, which the computer can store and use.

- Fixed-Point: Best for applications requiring fast, predictable, and simple arithmetic with fixed precision. Limited range and precision.
- Floating-Point: Best for applications requiring a wide range of representable numbers with variable precision. More complex and slower operations.

Both fixed-point and floating-point representations are essential for handling fractional numbers in computing. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for performance, precision, range, and predictability.
