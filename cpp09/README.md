### RPN
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) was developed primarily to solve several practical and theoretical problems in mathematics and computer science.

RPN provides a way to represent mathematical expressions that is simultaneously human-readable (with practice) and directly executable by a computer using minimal resources, which made it invaluable in the early days of computing when resources were severely constrained.
