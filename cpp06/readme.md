## CASTS

A Cast operator is a unary operator which forces one data type to be converted into another data type.

## C++ supports 5 types of casting:
### 1. C Style Casting
It is the casting used in the C language, and it is also used in C++. But in C++, usage of this type is not encouraged.

### 2. Static Cast (compile time)
This is the simplest type of cast that can be used. It is a compile-time cast. It does things like implicit conversions between types (such as int to float, or pointer to void*), and it can also call explicit conversion functions.

### 3. Dynamic Cast (runtime)
It is specifically designed for the polymorphic class,which have at least one virtual function.Dynamic cast operator allows us to check whether a pointer or reference to base pointer or references of a derived class.

### 4. Const Cast
It is used to change the value of the variable that is referenced through a pointer.

### 5. Reinterpret Cast
A low-level cast used to convert any pointer type to any other pointer type, and also to convert between pointer and integer types. Itâ€™s the least safe cast and is usually avoided unless absolutely necessary (e.g., for interfacing with low-level system code).

## rand() and srand() in C++:
- rand() generates a sequence of pseudo-random numbers based on an initial "seed" value.
- srand(seed) initializes the random number generator with a seed. Without calling srand(), rand() will produce the same sequence of numbers every time the program runs, because it defaults to a seed value of 1.
