### Namespace
In C++, a namespace is a named scope that provides a logical grouping for the identifiers it contains. It helps in organizing the code by encapsulating related names within a named scope, thus preventing naming collisions and making the code more modular, maintainable, and readable. (using namespace example : it's a bad habbit)

### Object-Oriented Programming.
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

- Class: It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
- Object: An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior. An Object is an instance of a Class.

- Constructor: is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally. The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object which is why it is known as a constructor.
Types of Constructor: Default Constructor, Parameterized Constructor, Copy Constructor, Move Constructor.

- Destructor: is an instance member function that is invoked automatically whenever an object is going to be destroyed. Meaning, a destructor is the last function that is going to be called before an object is destroyed.

- Static Member: static member is declared it will be treated as same for all the objects associated with the class. 

- Static Member Function: A static member function is independent of any object of the class, it can also be accessed using the class name through the scope resolution operator.
